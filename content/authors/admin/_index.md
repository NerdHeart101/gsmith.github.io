I work as the robotics coordinator for Texas Tech University. I also serve as the Program Delivery Coordinator for FIRST Tech Challenge in the West & Panhandle area of Texas and the Program Delivery Coordinator for FIRST LEGO League in the Panhandle area of Texas. I am a big advocate of robotics and STEM education, and I am always looking how to better provide and evolve robotics and coding programs for schools and organizations in West Texas. 

I am very much interested in the ideas of project-based and game-based learning and I am always looking to see how I can use my skills in robotics and computer science to make those GBL and PBL experiences better for educators and students of all grade levels.
